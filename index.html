<!-- Issues -->
<!-- Can't get the background image to show up- hero image. I have it saved to the folder -->

<!-- Samantha Peterson -->
<!-- Notes -->
<!-- Hero image is the large banner across the top of your main page -trying to grab attention and keep people on your page -->
<!-- notes mkdir creates new folder - cd in command line or terminal moves you from folder to folder -->
<!-- notes pwd in command line or terminal will let you see  where you are at ls will let you see if see if the folder you tried to make is there -->

<!-- notes Inline Styling  this is an example <h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 100px;">RUN BUDDY</h1> -->
<!-- notes Inline Styling  you could also write it out on several lines  -->

<!-- header is the child of body  -->

<!-- Having a code snapshot to refer to was helpful, there were a few items i made mistakes on
it was nice to have a road map to refer to to see where i had gotten off and where i needed to make adjustments
my tabs were not as cleaned up and some of my lines were a little bit out of order  
-->

<!-- mkdir <directory name> creates a new directory in the current directory.  -->
<!-- cd <directory name> changes into a new directory that's in the current directory. -->
<!-- touch <filename> creates new file in the current directory. -->
<!-- rm <filename> removes an existing file in the current directory.  -->
